Abstract

Privacy policies are essential tools for communicating data collection and usage practices to users. However, their often complex and technical language creates barriers to user understanding. This study investigates the readability of privacy policies using the Princeton-Leuven Longitudinal Corpus of Privacy Policies spanning over two decades, examining readability scores such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, SMOG index, and Flesch Reading Ease. 

Our findings reveal that most privacy policies are written at a level requiring advanced education, with the majority categorized as "difficult" or "very confusing." Over time, readability has declined, with policies becoming increasingly complex. We also examine the relationship between website popularity (measured by Alexa Rank) and policy readability, finding a weak but statistically significant correlation. Additionally, industry-specific analyses show that data-intensive sectors tend to have slightly more readable policies compared to others. 
 
These results highlight the challenges in enabling users' informed consent and underscore the need for more transparent and accessible communication.
